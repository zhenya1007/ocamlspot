OCamlSpotter - OCaml source browsing
==========================================

OCamlSpotter is a tool for OCaml source code browsing. You can search the type and definitions of values, expressions and modules.

OCamlSpotter 2.0.0 uses \*.cmt and \*.cmti files created by OCaml compiler 4.00.0 or newer with -bin-annot option.

Unlike OCamlSpotter 1.x, OCamlSpotter 2.0.0 is a standalone application. You NO LONGER need compiler patching. Just make, make install, and configure ocamlspot.el.
