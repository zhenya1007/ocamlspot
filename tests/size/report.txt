.cmt / .spot
=================

In the almost cases, spot is -5% to 15% smaller than cmt.

There are small number of modules whose spot is >10 times smaller than cmt: packed cmo's:

modulename                      cmt     spot    cmt/spot
otherlibs/dynlink/dynlinkaux	200499	4153	48.27
_build/camlp4/Camlp4/Struct	364921	2420	150.79
_build/camlp4/Camlp4/Printers	346783	1025	338.32

.cmti / .spit
=================

In average, the size of spit is 1/13 of the corresponding cmti.

[open M] enlarges the size of cmti when [M] is a big module,
while spit uses a constant size for opens.
